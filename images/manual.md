* **Do not use alcohol, gasoline, kerosene, or other corrosive or volatile solvents for cleaning, as they may damage the exterior and internal components of the vehicle.**

* **Do not use high-pressure water guns or hoses to wash the scooter.**
## Storage
* Store the vehicle in a flat, stable, dry, and cool indoor area, away from direct sunlight and rain, to prevent rust and premature aging of components.
* If the battery will not be used for an extended period, fully charge it and disconnect the battery plug. Recharge the battery at least once every two months to maintain its lifespan. Failure to do so may significantly reduce battery life or cause permanent damage.

## Spare Parts Maintenance
### Motor
* he motor does not require adjustment or maintenance under normal use; only surface dust removal and cleaning are needed. Do not apply lubricating oil to the transmission parts.
* When driving through water, the water level must not exceed the lower edge of the rear wheel motor bearing to prevent motor damage.
* Regularly inspect the motor wiring for looseness, check for any deformation, and ensure the phase wires are not damaged.
* Do not hit the motor hub, force the motor to run when rotation is blocked, or overload the motor.
* Do not drive on uneven road surfaces, as this can cause serious damage to the wheel hub and motor.
* The vehicle is pre-installed and adjusted to optimal condition before sale. Do not disassemble or modify electrical components or related parts. If you notice abnormal noises from the transmission, failure to power on, or any other issues while riding, contact an authorized dealer.
### Controller
The controller is factory-adjusted to optimal condition. In case of electrical failure or loss of control while riding, non-professional personnel should only inspect cables and connectors. If the issue persists, contact an authorized dealer immediately.
### Battery
* Always charge the battery according to the instructions using the original charger. Users are responsible for any consequences of improper charging.
* Do not use chargers of different voltages or battery types together. Do not charge non-rechargeable or incompatible batteries.
* Fully charge the vehicle before first use. Recharge promptly when the battery is low, as this helps extend battery life.
* When the battery is depleted, the system will automatically shut off. To prevent over-discharge and irreversible damage, always recharge the battery before use.
* When the battery level is around 20%, recharge promptly to develop a regular charging habit and prolong battery life. Failing to charge after riding can significantly reduce battery lifespan and may cause permanent damage.
* If the vehicle will not be used for an extended period, charge the battery at least once a month to maintain its lifespan and prevent power loss.
* Users and dealers must not modify the battery configuration or any other scooter components without prior authorization.
* Regular inspection and maintenance of your scooter at authorized dealers is recommended.

<strong>Danger</strong>
</div>
<div style="margin-left:30px">
<strong> • Do not dispose of waste batteries improperly to prevent environmental pollution.

• Keep children away from the battery charging area.</strong>
</div>

### Charger
* Do not transport the charger with the vehicle, as vibration may damage its internal electronic components.
* Place the charger in a well-ventilated area. Do not charge in enclosed spaces, under direct sunlight, or in high-temperature environments.
* During charging, if the indicator light behaves abnormally, there is a strange smell, or the charger casing overheats, stop charging immediately and have the charger repaired or replaced.
* Keep hands dry when plugging or unplugging the power supply. Do not allow conductive materials to contact the battery charging port or the connectors on both ends of the charging cable simultaneously.
* After the battery is fully charged, first turn off the power supply, then disconnect the battery plug.
* When the green light turns on, disconnect the power promptly. Do not leave the charger connected to AC power unnecessarily.
* Do not disassemble or modify the charger. If a fault occurs, contact an authorized dealer.
* The charger should not be used by disabled persons or individuals with sensory or mental impairments (including children) unless supervised or guided by someone responsible for their safety.
* Keep children away from the charger to prevent accidents.
